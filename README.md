## Citect ProcessData migration
Using the SQL script, the process data for Numeric Samples, Digital Samples & String Samples is migrated to Wonderware Historian.

1. This script expects the start and end dates as parameters to process the Historical data from Citect Historian to Wonderware Historian
1. It will process the entire data from Citect Historian, if datetime parameters are Null
1. Script has the ability to resume the process from where it has left last time
   * It processes the data in a batches of 1 day
   * If the query is interrupted or ended, it has the ability to resume from date. (This information is being persisted through a table 'ProcessedTime')

Limitations / cautions:

Note that the values will be processed as >= and <=, and make sure there is no time overlap, to avoid duplication of entries
